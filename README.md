# :rocket: Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone is the 10th (final) course in [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) specialization, which summarizes in the form of a project that covers all materials that have been learned during this specialization.
## :page_facing_up: Project Background
The most prosperous business of the commercial space era, SpaceX 
has reduced the cost of space travel. On its website, the firm promotes 
Falcon 9 rocket flights, which start at 62 million dollars; in comparison, 
other suppliers charge up to 165 million dollars each launch; a large portion 
of the cost reductions are attributable to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first 
stage. Thus, we can calculate the cost of a launch if we can ascertain if the 
first stage will land. We will forecast if SpaceX will reuse the first stage based 
on available data and machine learning techniques.

## :page_facing_up: Questions to be answered 
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of 
flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing? 
- Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years? 
- What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification 
in this case?
